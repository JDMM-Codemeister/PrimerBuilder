# PrimerBuilder  

## About  
Compute appropriate primers for a given sequence.  
-GC content between 40 and 60% with the 3’ of a primer ending in G or C to promote binding. A GC Clamp.  
-Not too many repeating G or C bases, as this can cause primer-dimer formation.  
-Primer length is around 18-30 bases.   
-Melting temperature (Tm) of the primers between 65°C and 75°C, and within 5°C of each other.  
-Have a balanced distribution of GC-rich and AT-rich domains.  
-Avoid runs of 4 or more of one base, or dinucleotide repeats (for example, GAAAA or CACACACA).  
-Avoid intra-primer homology (more than 3 bases that complement within the primer) or inter-primer homology (forward and reverse primers having complementary sequences).  
-If you are using the primers for mutagenesis, try to have the mismatched bases towards the middle of the primer.
